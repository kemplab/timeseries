Unpack catch22 functions in the MATLAB root folder together with catch22.m and timeseries_features.m  
In timeseries_features.m change the input and output paths, make sure the path to "headers.csv" is correct as well.  
Run timeseries_features.m to calculate metrics from your time series data.  

2-12_all_flux.csv contains raw data for cardiomyocyte OCR time series with corresponding end point cTnT values for regression. It can be used as an example input for the timeseries_features.m
